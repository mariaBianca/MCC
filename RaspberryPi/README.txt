The raspberry Pi camera configuration has been taken from:
//github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.git

The configurations have been changed after the presentation, as a new Raspberry Pi has been bought for a better performance towards the industrial presentation, and other features have been implemented than the ones that have been available during the presentation in school.
