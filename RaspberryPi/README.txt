The raspberry Pi camera configuration has been taken from:
//github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.git

The configurations have been changed after the presentation, as a new Raspberry Pi has been bought
for a better performance towards the industrial presentation. The team has received a model 1 with a very
low performance, but has purchased during the past week a model 3B.
Other features have been
implemented than the ones that have been available during the presentation in school.
